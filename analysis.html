        The majority of marine incidents are attributable to human error.[<a href="#1">1</a>]
        Even so, the environmental conditions and the condition of the vessel can strongly influence the likelihood and severity of the incident.
        To be able to predict, and hopefully prevent, these types of incidents, we need to have a deep understanding of the context in which these accidents occur.

        </center>

        Note that fishing vessels, passenger ships and towing vessels experience diurnality, or more activity during the day than the night.
        Barge vessels are less diurnal, primarily as they interact less with people and remain out on the water for longer periods of time.
      </p>

          <h2>Incidents</h2>
          <p>One interesting way to look at the data is to visualize where incidents have taken place over time. The following figure shows the last four months of incidents in every frame, and makes it easy to see how concentrations move around over time.</p>

          </div>

          <p>The incidents in this data set also display interesting seasonal trends.</p>

          <h2>Injuries</h2>
          <p>This is the write-up for a Fall 2013 final project in <a href="http://www.cs109.org">CS 109</a> (Data Science) at <a href="http://seas.harvard.edu">Harvard University</a>.</p>

          <h2>Pollution</h2>
          <img class="pull-right" src="img/nounproj/icon_9273.png" width="100px" />
          <p>
            The oceans and waterways are so vast that until recently, humans assumed that no matter how much trash and chemicals we dump into them, the impact would be negligible.
            Whilst most of this pollution is caused by land based run-offs, ships and offshore platforms are also a significant contributor.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our analysis, we studied what contaminants most commonly end up in the oceans and what types of vessels are most responsible.
          </p>

          <p>
            In our dataset, we have 16,589 incidents in which pollution was spilled into a body of water.
            If we look at the reported incidents by vessel type, it appears initially as though Recreational boats are the major concern.

            </center>
          </p>

          <h4>Liquid pollution</h4>

          <p>
            In our dataset, there were 17,289 pollution incidents involving liquids.
            The majority of these liquid pollutants were <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hydraulic, lubricating, crude, and so on">oils</a>, gasoline, calcium chloride, and asphalt.

              <img class="" width="600px" src="img/liquid_pollution.png" />
            </center>
          </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>What we found was surprising:</p>
              <p class="hero">Just 100 of those 16,780 incidents were responsible for over 90% of the pollution.</p>
            </blockquote>

              <img class="" width="600px" src="img/liquid_pollution_distribution.png" />
            </center>

            The average incident only resulted in a loss of <b>95.1</b> gallons of pollutant, yet the top 100 incidents resulted in an average loss of <b>12,033.0</b> gallons of pollutant.
            Even if we were able to prevent the majority of less severe incidents, the overall liquid pollutant lost would be minimally impact.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h4>Solid pollution</h4>

          <p>
            There are far less incidents involving solid pollutants compared to liquid pollutants.
            In this case, just two incidents are responsible for over 95% of the pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The majority of this was a single incident, when the barge NMS-1477, loaded with 197,000 gallons of concentrated (97%) sulfuric acid (H2SO4), <a href="http://incidentnews.noaa.gov/entry/6227">capsized in a Texan port</a>.
